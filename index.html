## Hello there.

This is the website addition to my  [hopscotch account](https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/explore-channel/user.html?u=5zmt7t-1kww_78-48iftsoruk_3jsvat8rld_2wya8p2!1pwl!2rrvu6iagp_264f&channel=Published) where I can post trailers and introduce myself a bit better.

This is the real Albus_Dumbledore from hopscotch. Make sure to not confuse this site with any other's or impostor's.

## About Me

This section is all about myself. These are questions that I can publicly display answer's to.

### Questions: 

- How did you hear about hopscotch? 
<br>
My teacher showed me the hopscotch app. I was reintroduced last year after a long break.

- What is your favorite project to play/code? 
<br>
Any project that I can actually enjoy playing myself, otherwise, I would choose miscellaneous Pixel Art.

- Why are you obsessed with Raccoon? 
<br>
I think that Raccoon is a character with a lot of potential. I think that he is awesome, and deserves a chance in the light.

- How do you get good at coding? 
<br>
There is no such thing as good coding. There are only people who are dedicated. To become dedicated, you need practice and time.

- What is your favorite part about coding? 
<br>
The infinite possibilites about what you can code. One object can create a whole game. Who knows about many objects?

- Favorite project of yours?
